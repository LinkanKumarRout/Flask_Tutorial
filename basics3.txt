Flask Request Object
---------------------
The data from a clients web page is sent to the server as a global request object. In order to process the request data, it should be imported from the Flask module.

Important attributes of request object are listed below −

Form − It is a dictionary object containing key and value pairs of form parameters and their values.
args − parsed contents of query string which is part of URL after question mark (?).
Cookies − dictionary object holding Cookie names and values.
files − data pertaining to uploaded file.
method − current request method.

Flask Sending Form Data to Template
------------------------------------
We have already seen that the http method can be specified in URL rule. The Form data received by the triggered function can collect it in the form of a dictionary object and forward it to a template to render it on a corresponding web page.
In the following example, / URL renders a web page (student.html) which has a form. The data filled in it is posted to the /result URL which triggers the result() function.
The results() function collects form data present in request.form in a dictionary object and sends it for rendering to result.html.
The template dynamically renders an HTML table of form data.
Given below is the Python code of application −

from flask import Flask, render_template, request
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def student():
   return render_template('student.html')

@app.route('/result',methods = ['POST', 'GET'])
def result():
   if request.method == 'POST':
      result = request.form
      return render_template("result.html",result = result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
   app.run(debug = True)

Given below is the HTML script of student.html.
<html>
   <body>
      <form action = "http://localhost:5000/result" method = "POST">
         <p>Name <input type = "text" name = "Name" /></p>
         <p>Physics <input type = "text" name = "Physics" /></p>
         <p>Chemistry <input type = "text" name = "chemistry" /></p>
         <p>Maths <input type ="text" name = "Mathematics" /></p>
         <p><input type = "submit" value = "submit" /></p>
      </form>
   </body>
</html>

Code of template (result.html) is given below −
<!doctype html>
<html>
   <body>
      <table border = 1>
         {% for key, value in result.items() %}
            <tr>
               <th> {{ key }} </th>
               <td> {{ value }} </td>
            </tr>
         {% endfor %}
      </table>
   </body>
</html>

Run the Python script and enter the URL http://localhost:5000/ in the browser.
